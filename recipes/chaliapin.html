            <li>1 tbsp Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp beef fat (beef dripping) or a neutral oil with a high smoke point (like vegetable oil or canola)</li>
            <li>300g Cooked Japanese short grain white rice</li>
            <li>3 Umeboshi pickled plums (optional)</li>
            <li>4 Shiso leaves or Ooba leaves (optional)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Spring onion <em>chopped - to garnish</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>75ml (5 tbsp) Red wine</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Water  + 1 tsp Corn starch (or potato starch)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Prepping Steaks</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grate or blitz one of the white onions in a food processor to make a chunky paste.</li>
            <li>Wrap the steaks with cling film and tenderise using a meat tenderiser or a rolling pin. Beat until approx 1.5 - 2cm thick (approx ¾ inch).</li>
            <li>Unwrap the steaks and score the top and bottom diagonally with a sharp knife. Cut lightly over the surfaces, make sure not to cut all the way through.</li>
            <li>Take a plate or container large enough for your steaks and line the bottom with half of the grated onion. Spread the other half over the top of the steaks and make sure they're completely covered.</li>
            <li>Cover the container with a lid or cling film and leave in a cool place for 30 minutes. (Don't refrigerate.)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Sauteed Onions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop the other 2 onions.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tbsp of butter in a frying pan on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of your chopped onions and cook until the colour turns lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Once it reaches a light gold colour, add a pinch of salt and stir. Continue to fry until golden brown.</li>
            <li>When it's cooked, set it aside for later.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cooking Steak</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Scrape the chopped onion off of the steak and discard.</li>
            <li>Wash the steak under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle each side with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat up a frying pan on high and once it's smoking, add 1 tbsp of beef fat or oil.</li>
            <li>Once the fat is heated, add the steak to the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry the steak until it's slightly charred and flip it over.</li>
            <li>Fry for about 30 seconds and then check the softness by poking the centre of the steak with your finger. Press your thumb and index finger together to make an O.K sign, for a rare steak, the softness should be the same as the palm area below your thumb. Check the "doneness test" in the post above for more details.</li>
            <li>ce the steak is cooked to rare or medium-rare, transfer to a plate and leave to rest.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the same pan as you cooked the steaks, melt 1 tbsp of butter on a medium heat until you can smell the butter aroma.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp soy sauce and cook until you can smell the soy sauce aroma. </li>
            <li>Next add 75ml (5 tbsp) red wine to the sauce.</li>
            <li>The juices from the steak should have leaked out onto the plate by now, pour those juices into the sauce for extra flavour. </li>
            <li>Let the sauce bubble for a few minutes to burn off the alcohol. </li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix 1 tbsp cold water with 1 tsp corn starch and pour it into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Mix until the sauce is thickened and then remove it from the heat. </li>      
        </ol>

        <h3>Ume Rice (Optional Steps)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the shiso leaves into thin strips.</li>
            <li>Remove the seeds from the umeboshi. </li>
            <li>Using a knife, cut the umeboshi into small pieces until it becomes a paste.</li>
            <li>Put 300g of cooked white rice into a large bowl and add the umeboshi paste and finely sliced shiso leaves.</li>
            <li>Mix well.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Dishing Up</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Divide the rice into two bowls.</li>
           <li>Slice the steak meat into bite size pieces and lay them on the top of the rice.</li>
           <li>Pile up the sautéed onion on top and drizzle with the red wine sauce.</li>
           <li>Garnish with chopped spring onion.</li>
           <li>Enjoy!</li> 
        </ol>
